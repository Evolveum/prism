	 * Returns a name of the type for this definition.
	 *
	 * The type can be part of the compile-time schema or it can be defined at run time.
	 *
	 * Examples of the former case are types like c:UserType, xsd:string, or even flexible
	 * ones like c:ExtensionType or c:ShadowAttributesType.
	 *
	 * Examples of the latter case are types used in
	 * - custom extensions, like ext:LocationsType (where ext = e.g. http://example.com/extension),
	 * - resource schema, like ri:inetOrgPerson (ri = http://.../resource/instance-3),
	 * - connector schema, like TODO
	 *
	 * In XML representation that corresponds to the name of the XSD type. Although beware, the
	 * run-time types do not have statically defined structure. And the resource and connector-related
	 * types may even represent different kinds of objects within different contexts (e.g. two
	 * distinct resources both with ri:AccountObjectClass types).
	 *
	 * Also note that for complex type definitions, the type name serves as a unique identifier.
	 * On the other hand, for item definitions, it is just one of its attributes; primary key
	 * is item name in that case.
	 *
	 * The type name should be fully qualified. (TODO reconsider this)

	 *  - c:user, c:UserType - statically defined type with statically defined content.

	 *  - ri:inetOrgPerson, ext:LocationsType, ext:locations - both the entity
